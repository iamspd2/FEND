# Travel App

This is my capstone project for the FEND program. This web app allows users to plan trips. Users enter the name of the destination along with its country code. I use Geonames API to get the latitude and longitude of the place in order to retrieve the exact weather forecast as per the travel date from WeatherBit API, and an image of the place from Pixabay API. The user can save those trips for future reference.
