# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Project
Starter code taken from Udacity FEND repository
* I implemented all the functionality along with necessary changes to build this app.
* I generated the OpenWeatherMap API and used it in this project.
* I set the country as India (,in) to make the API calls, which can be changed as per the country code inside the `website/app.js` file.
* To test the project, simply cd to this folder, run `node server.js` and visit `localhost:3000`.
