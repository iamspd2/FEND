          The world stops here for ninety minutes. Even for the all powerful presidents of the host nation Russia, the finalists France and Croatia and of course FIFA, they joined the crowd of 78000 people at the iconic Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow to witness enthralling and engrossing footballing drama. It is not just another ninety minutes of football, it is the grandest game of them all. It’s the pinnacle of existence for any footballer. The prize at stake? <em>The FIFA World Cup Trophy.</em>
        </p>
        <blockquote>A place in the history books, and immortality in your countrymen’s hearts. After all the drama and upsets we’d seen so far, there was no clear favorite in this one. France with one of the strongest sides did make it all the way to the final. Their opponents? Probably no one even in their wildest dreams would’ve imagined. The smallest nation ever to reach the final since Uruguay in 1950, Croatia.</blockquote>

          Redemption for Didier Deschamps’ team as they bury their ghosts from the Euros two years back while he makes history by becoming only <strong>the third man to win the World Cup both as a player and as a coach.</strong> The Croatian tears were engulfed in the rain who really put on a show throughout the tournament that did themselves and their entire nation proud.

          As for France, they’re on top of the world and to sum it up in Peter Drury’s words, <u>"Be honest. Whoever you are, wherever you are, no matter the age you are, no matter which team you support, there’s a little bit of you that wants to be Kylian Mbappe tonight."</u>
